Contributing to MVComp
========

You want to contribute to MVComp? Great! This guide will help you get started.

**You don't have to be an expert!**

Contributing to open source software is a great way of learning by doing, and we are happy to help you out if you have questions or get stuck.

**What to do**

Every contribution helps -- whether it's fixing a typo in the documentation or adding an entire new feature. Often it's a good idea to start by fixing a smaller issue to get familiar with the process. If you don't know where to start, you can look at the `issues on github <https://github.com/neuralabc/mvcomp/issues>`_.

**Git/Github**

To contribute you will need to know some basics about git and Github, which are not covered in this guide. There are lots of tutorials online (e.g. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials, especially "Getting started" and "Collaborating")

**Questions?**

Github issues are the best place to ask questions about the code.

**Ready to go?**
Once you have read this guide, you can start by forking the repository and making your changes. When you are done, you can create a pull request to merge your changes back into the main repository.
